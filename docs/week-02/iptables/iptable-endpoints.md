# Kubernetes Service → Endpoints → iptables (kube-proxy) Lab

## Objective

Understand how **Kubernetes Services route traffic to Pods using kube-proxy and iptables**.

This lab demonstrates:

- How a **Service forwards traffic to Pods**
- How **Endpoints are created**
- How **kube-proxy updates iptables rules**
- How traffic automatically updates when **Pods change**

---

# Lab Environment

Check cluster information:

```bash
kind get clusters
kubectl get nodes

Example output:

NAME                         STATUS   ROLES           AGE
iptables-lab-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   5m
Step 1 — Create Deployment

Create an nginx deployment with 2 replicas.

kubectl create deployment nginx-demo --image=nginx --replicas=2

Check the pods:

kubectl get pods -o wide

Example output:

NAME                        READY   STATUS    IP
nginx-demo-xxxxx            1/1     Running   10.244.0.12
nginx-demo-yyyyy            1/1     Running   10.244.0.13

These Pod IPs become Service Endpoints.

Step 2 — Create Service

Expose the deployment as a ClusterIP Service.

kubectl expose deployment nginx-demo --port=80

Check the service:

kubectl get svc

Example output:

NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP
nginx-demo   ClusterIP   10.96.239.59

The Service now routes traffic to the nginx pods.

Step 3 — Observe iptables Rules

Enter the kind control-plane node container.

docker exec -it iptables-lab-control-plane sh

Check iptables rules:

iptables -t nat -L | grep KUBE-SEP

Example output:

/* default/nginx-demo -> 10.244.0.12:80 */
statistic mode random probability 0.50000000000

/* default/nginx-demo -> 10.244.0.13:80 */
Meaning

Service nginx-demo forwards traffic to two backend pods.

Service
   ↓
10.244.0.12:80
10.244.0.13:80

The probability rule performs load balancing.

50% → Pod1
50% → Pod2
Step 4 — Delete Pods

Delete all pods:

kubectl delete pods -l app=nginx-demo

The Deployment controller automatically recreates new pods.

Check pods again:

kubectl get pods -o wide

Example output:

NAME                        READY   STATUS    IP
nginx-demo-aaaaa            1/1     Running   10.244.0.14
nginx-demo-bbbbb            1/1     Running   10.244.0.15

Pod IPs changed.

Step 5 — Observe iptables Update

Check iptables rules again:

iptables -t nat -L | grep KUBE-SEP

Example output:

/* default/nginx-demo -> 10.244.0.14:80 */
statistic mode random probability 0.50000000000

/* default/nginx-demo -> 10.244.0.15:80 */

Old pod IPs were automatically removed.

What Happened Internally

When pods change, Kubernetes automatically updates networking.

Pod Created / Deleted
        ↓
Endpoint Controller updates Endpoints
        ↓
API Server updated
        ↓
kube-proxy detects change
        ↓
kube-proxy rewrites iptables rules
Actual Traffic Flow

Packet routing inside the cluster:

Client Pod
   ↓
Service IP
   ↓
iptables rule match
   ↓
DNAT rewrite
   ↓
Backend Pod IP

Example:

Before iptables rewrite:

SRC: pod-ip
DST: service-ip

After iptables rewrite:

SRC: pod-ip
DST: backend-pod-ip

This is called DNAT (Destination NAT).

iptables Chain Flow

Actual packet traversal:

Client
  ↓
KUBE-SERVICES
  ↓
KUBE-SVC-XXXX
  ↓
Load balancing rule
  ↓
KUBE-SEP-XXXX
  ↓
Pod IP
Why Random Probability Appears

Example rule:

statistic mode random probability 0.50000000000

Meaning:

50% traffic → Pod A
50% traffic → Pod B

This is iptables-based load balancing.

Production Scenario Simulated

This lab simulates a real production situation.

Pod crash
   ↓
Endpoint removed
   ↓
kube-proxy updates iptables
   ↓
Traffic redirected to healthy pods

Users do not experience downtime.

This demonstrates Kubernetes self-healing networking.

Useful Debug Commands

Check endpoints:

kubectl get endpoints nginx-demo

Check EndpointSlices:

kubectl get endpointslices

Check kube-proxy logs:

kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-proxy

Check service iptables rules:

iptables-save | grep nginx-demo
Important Production Insight

iptables works well for small clusters.

Large clusters may have:

10,000 services
50,000 pods

iptables rules become very large.

Many organizations now use Cilium instead of kube-proxy.

Instead of iptables:

Service
   ↓
eBPF map lookup
   ↓
Pod

This provides faster networking.
