eBPF & Cilium — Kubernetes Networking (Beginner Notes)

This document explains:

What eBPF is

Why Cilium uses eBPF

How map lookups work

How traffic flows inside the kernel

How Cilium improves networking & security

1. What is eBPF?

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a Linux kernel technology that allows programs to run inside the kernel safely.

Instead of sending packets to userspace tools, the kernel itself processes networking logic.

eBPF can be used for:

networking

security enforcement

monitoring

observability

tracing

2. Why eBPF Exists

Traditional Linux networking tools use rule-based processing.

Example (iptables):

packet
 ↓
rule1
rule2
rule3
rule4
...
match

Problem:

More rules → slower processing

Large Kubernetes clusters may create thousands of rules.

eBPF solves this using map lookups (hash tables).

3. Map Lookup Concept (Very Important)

eBPF stores networking data inside BPF Maps.

Think of this like a HashMap / dictionary.

Example map:

Key                Value
--------------------------------
Service IP         Pod IPs

Example:

10.96.0.10 → [10.244.1.5, 10.244.2.7]

Request arrives:

curl 10.96.0.10

Kernel performs lookup:

lookup(10.96.0.10)

Result:

10.244.2.7

Packet forwarded to the selected pod.

Why this is fast
HashMap lookup = O(1)

Instead of scanning thousands of rules.

4. Packet Flow Using eBPF

When a packet arrives:

Packet
 ↓
Linux Kernel
 ↓
eBPF program
 ↓
BPF Map Lookup
 ↓
Decision (route / allow / deny)

Example:

Service IP → Pod IP
5. What is Cilium?

Cilium is a Kubernetes CNI that uses eBPF for networking and security.

It replaces:

kube-proxy
iptables

Meaning traffic routing happens using kernel-level eBPF programs.

6. Kubernetes Networking With Cilium

Traditional Kubernetes networking:

Client
 ↓
Service
 ↓
kube-proxy
 ↓
iptables rules
 ↓
Pod

Cilium networking:

Client
 ↓
Service
 ↓
eBPF program
 ↓
BPF map lookup
 ↓
Pod

This removes the need for iptables rule scanning.

7. iptables vs eBPF
Feature	iptables	eBPF
Processing	rule matching	map lookup
Speed	slower	very fast
Scalability	limited	very high
Used by	kube-proxy	Cilium

Example comparison:

iptables:

packet
 ↓
rule1
rule2
rule3
rule4
...

eBPF:

packet
 ↓
lookup(service_ip)
 ↓
pod
8. eBPF Hook Points (Where Programs Attach)

eBPF programs attach to different points in the Linux networking stack.

Important hook points:

Hook	Purpose
XDP	earliest packet processing
TC	traffic control
Socket hooks	application-level traffic

Typical packet path:

Network Card
 ↓
XDP hook
 ↓
Linux network stack
 ↓
TC hook
 ↓
BPF map lookup
 ↓
Pod network interface
 ↓
Pod container
9. Security Policies in Cilium

Cilium can enforce policies at multiple layers.

Layer 3 Policy (IP Level)

Controls which pods can talk to which pods.

Example:

frontend → backend allowed
frontend → database denied
Layer 4 Policy (Port Level)

Controls which ports are allowed.

Example:

frontend → backend TCP 80 allowed
frontend → backend TCP 22 denied
Layer 7 Policy (Application Level)

Controls application requests (HTTP APIs).

Example:

Allow  : GET /products
Allow  : POST /login
Deny   : DELETE /users

This allows API-level security.

10. Observability with Hubble

Cilium provides a tool called Hubble.

Hubble shows real-time network flows.

Example output:

frontend → backend   allowed
backend → database   allowed
frontend → database  denied

Benefits:

visualize service communication

debug network issues

security monitoring

11. Example Microservice Traffic

Example application architecture:

User
 ↓
Frontend
 ↓
API Gateway
 ↓
Auth Service
 ↓
Payment Service
 ↓
Database

Example security policies:

Frontend → API Gateway allowed
API Gateway → Auth allowed
API Gateway → Payment allowed
Payment → Database allowed
Frontend → Database denied

This approach is called:

Zero Trust Networking
12. Quick Recall (Interview Summary)
eBPF
Linux kernel technology
for fast networking and security
Cilium
Kubernetes CNI using eBPF
Key Advantage
iptables → sequential rules
eBPF → map lookup
Layer Security
L3 → IP communication
L4 → Port communication
L7 → Application request filtering
13. One-Line Mental Model
iptables = rule scanning
eBPF = hash map lookup

or

Old networking → rule based
Modern networking → program based
